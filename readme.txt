Description: 
    Ski.io is an online multiplayer game where the objective is to 
    move (skii) around the level, collecting balls of mass, making you bigger as 
    you go.. You cant stop moving and are always going slightly left or right. 
    You can also boost, to lose a percentage of your mass, and gain a significant 
    speed boost. If you are larger than other players you can eat them, adding 
    their mass to your own.

Controls: 
    A - Move left
    D - Move Right
    Space - Boost

Recommendations:
    We recommend you play the game with your browser size set to 90%. The game will 
    work at any (reasonable) zoom percentage, but we've found this to be the ideal setting.
